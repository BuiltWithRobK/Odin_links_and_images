    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        The field coffee is inspired by all my time in the woods. Nothing gets a day going
        out in the woods quite like a solid cup of coffee. Whether it is the coffee itself
        or the process of making it, it is a complete moral booster or just the perfect slow
        start to the day.
